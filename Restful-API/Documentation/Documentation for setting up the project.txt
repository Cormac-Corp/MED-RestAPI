--- Starting a ubuntu vagrant box and running the NodeJS server ---

NOTE: You can download all these files from gitlab and assumes you have vagrant installed. 

Step 1. Start a command prompt.
Step 2. Change directory into the folder containing the Vagrantfile.
Note: you might need to vagrant box update, because the version may be outdated.
Step 3. Type vagrant up
Step 4. Type vagrant init

*From this point on we will ssh into the virtual machine and work from there.

Step 5. Type vagrant ssh
Step 6. Type cd /vagrant
NOte: If you ls after this step you should see all the files linked from your vagrant folder. If not, one possible solution is you did not update the box.
Step 7. cd into web-services
step 8. type npm start
Note: We're using nodejs so I'm assuming you already have nodejs downloaded onto your box. 
Note: If not, please download nodejs before continuation.

Step 9. Open the program POSTMAN. Download link is here https://www.getpostman.com/
Step 10. Type http://localhost:3001/ into the postman bar
Step 11. If you get the message "Connected" then . . .

Congradulations, you have setup the nodejs server and happy coding :)!
